	<h1>How We Met</h1>
	<p>
		<br /> Toward the beginning of February I was talking with one of my
		best friends, Bret Wilson, who is engaged to a long-time friend of
		Molly's, Kelly Brodowski. During this conversation I told Bret that
		all I wanted was to meet a NICE girl, a girl who was kind and polite
		and who would be nice to me. I wasn't asking him to introduce me to
		anyone; we were just having a conversation about relationships. Bret
		said you should meet Molly. I asked who Molly was and he told me a
		little bit about her. At first, I wasn't up to the idea of being
		introduced to someone; I wanted to find them on my own. So, I told him
		I wasn't interested in any of Kelly's friends. I went on with my life
		and forgot about the conversation completely.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br /> A couple weeks later I was over at Bret's apartment again and
		we were talking about something and he again told me I meet Molly.
		Again, I hesitated at the thought of being set up with someone.
		However, this time the thought stayed in my head. It stayed in my
		head, and I started thinking to myself, what if she is really nice,
		what if she is someone for me? After three days of thinking about
		being set up with Molly, I called Bret. I told him that I wanted to
		meet her. At this time February was coming to an end.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br /> Bret said he would have Kelly work the details out with Molly.
		I'm sure Molly will have things to add to this part because I am not
		really sure what all was said. All I knew was that we were supposed to
		meet in a little over a week.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br /> Time passed slowly as I began to get more and more open to the
		idea. Thoughts were racing through my head. Would I like her? Is she
		going to like me? What am I supposed to talk to her about? Most of
		all, I just wanted to make sure she was nice. I worried about how I
		would tell her I wasn't interested in her if she wasn't what I was
		looking for. I didn't want to make Bret and Kelly look bad.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br /> Finally, the day came. I get a call from Bret, he tells me he
		is sick and isn't sure if he will be able to go that night. I thought,
		what if he is lying, what if Molly canceled? I was nervous. I didn't
		know what to think. Later that night we rescheduled, for March 16th.
		Time slowed, I had no idea what this person was like. I didn't know
		what she liked. What was I supposed to talk to her about?
	</p>
	<p>
		<br /> March 16th finally rolls around. I can't say that I was very
		focused that day in class. I even thought about writing down things in
		advance to talk about. Dinner time finally arrived; it was time to
		meet them at the restaurant.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br /> When I first saw Molly, I introduced myself, and said something
		I thought was funny. She giggled and I thought she might just
		understand me. From the very start I was intrigued by her, I thought
		she was beautiful before she even said a word. I thought to myself,
		I'm going to try as hard as I can to win her over.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br /> We had dinner, talked sparingly, and had a couple laughs. After
		dinner we headed back to Bret and Kelly's apartment to hang out a
		while longer. I told her I was interested in getting to know her and
		asked her if she felt the same. I was pleasantly surprised when she
		said yes. I asked for her phone number and if I could text her, she
		gave it to me!
